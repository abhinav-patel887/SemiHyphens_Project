# SemiHyphens_Project
I have developed static front-end pages using HTML and CSS for this project. The current scope focuses solely on the design and layout of the website, without incorporating any back-end or JavaScript functionalities. This work is dedicated to crafting a visually appealing and responsive interface.

I am grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with the Semi Hyphens organization and contribute to their efforts. This project showcases my skills in front-end development and my commitment to delivering high-quality work..
